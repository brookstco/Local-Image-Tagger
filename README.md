# Local Image Tagger
 Small program to tag, search, and sort locally saved images as a project to practice coding.

 There are already several good free options for tagging and searching photographs. Notably there is Adobe Bridge and [FastPhotoTagger](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fastphototagger/). However, while both are good for keeping photos in check, they aren't very easy for what I want.
 
 The purpose of this program is to help sort reference images for art to allow for rapidly finding good references from a local collection. Thus the ease of searching is as important as the ease of tagging, and descriptive tags are more important than photo metadata.
